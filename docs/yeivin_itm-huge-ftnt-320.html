<h1>More than a few dozen disjunctives without the expected
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span></h1>
<p>My research disagrees with this estimate of a few dozen. I find 133 disjunctives without the
expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. This is far more than could be called a few dozen.
This discrepancy probably comes from one or more of the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe my base text differs significantly from that of
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. In particular,
maybe its use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> differs significantly. (My base text is
<abbr title="Miqra According to the Masorah" class="small-caps">MAM</abbr>.)</li>
<li>Maybe my interpretation of ambiguous marks differs significantly from that of
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. In particular,
maybe one or more of the following differs significantly:<ul>
<li>Which <span class="romanized">shewa</span> marks are considered vocal, and which silent.</li>
<li>Which <span class="romanized">begad-kefat</span> <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> marks are
considered <span class="romanized">ḥazaq</span>, and which <span class="romanized">qal</span>.</li>
<li>Which <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> marks are considered
<span class="romanized">gadol</span>, and which ḥaṭuf
(<span class="romanized">qaṭan</span>).</li>
<li>Which <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> marks are considered
<span class="romanized">gadol</span>, and which <span class="romanized">qaṭan</span>.</li>
</ul>
(Except for <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>, my interpretation of ambiguous marks comes from
<a href="https://mg.alhatorah.org/">Al-Hatorah</a> and
<abbr title="Miqra According to the Masorah" class="small-caps">MAM</abbr>. For
<span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>, for the moment I use the approximation that it is
<span class="romanized">gadol</span> only in full spellings, i.e.
<span class="romanized">gadol</span> only if followed by a non-consonantal
<span class="romanized">yod</span>, and <span class="romanized">qaṭan</span> otherwise.)</li>
<li>Maybe my placement of stress differs significantly from that of
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. A non-impositive
accent without a stress helper can be considered a kind of ambiguous mark, somewhat like the
ambiguous marks discussed above. For example, without a stress helper, the placement of stress is
ambiguous in a word with  the prepositive <span class="romanized">telisha gedolah</span> or the
postpositive <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span>. The placement of stress can also be ambiguous
for certain paired poetic accents. (My placement of stress comes from
<abbr title="Miqra According to the Masorah" class="small-caps">MAM</abbr>.)</li>
<li>Maybe my definition of “a disjunctive without the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>”
differs significantly from that of
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll expand on that final possible source of discrepancy between me and
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. The definition of
“a disjunctive without the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” may, at first glance, seem
clear, but there are some gray areas. Should a word like
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@1K 6:22" title="1K 6:22">אֲֽשֶׁר־לַדְּבִ֖יר</bdi> be counted as an
<abbr title="fully regular pattern #1: מִתְקַטְּלִים">FR1</abbr> disjunctive without the expected
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>? For sure, it does lack a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>
in the expected location: it lacks a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on
<bdi lang="hbo">שֶׁר</bdi>&thinsp;, the main part of the closed, short-vowelled syllable two before
the stress. But, as covered in
<a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-333" data-num-of-sec="333">#333</a>, this
likely reflects a preference (at least in this word) for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on
<span class="romanized">shewa</span> over the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. A word
pointed according to this preference is not as strong an exception to the rule as a word that has no
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> marks anywhere, like the
<abbr title="fully regular pattern #3: מִתְפַּעֲלִים">FR3</abbr> words
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Lev 27:32" title="Lev 27:32">אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲבֹ֖ר</bdi> and
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@1K 20:22" title="1K 20:22">אֲשֶׁר־תַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה</bdi>&thinsp;. Should
an exception of any “strength” be counted, or only the starkest exceptions? I find that 31 of the
133 disjunctives without the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> nonetheless have a
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> elsewhere. Some additional examples are
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Dan 11:16" title="Dan 11:16">בְּאֶֽרֶץ־הַצְּבִ֖י</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #1: מִתְקַטְּלִים">FR1</abbr>)
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@1S 30:2" title="1S 30:2">וַיִּֽנְהֲג֔וּ</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #2: מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים">FR2</abbr>), and
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Jer 29:23" title="Jer 29:23">וַיְנַֽאֲפוּ֙</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #3: מִתְפַּעֲלִים">FR3</abbr>).</p>
<p>How should we count words having a secondary accent where we would expect a
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>? E.g., should a word like
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Lev 25:7" title="Lev 25:7">וְלִ֨בְהֶמְתְּךָ֔</bdi> be counted as an
<abbr title="fully regular pattern #2: מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים">FR2</abbr> disjunctive without the expected
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, or does the <span class="romanized">metigah</span> function as
the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>? I find that 6 of the 133 disjunctives without the
expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> nonetheless have a
<span class="romanized">metigah</span> where we would expect a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.
Also, in two cases I find a <span class="romanized">merka</span> (paired with
<span class="romanized">azla legarmeh</span>) where we would expect a
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>:
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Ps 2:2" title="Ps 2:2">יִ֥תְיַצְּב֨וּ׀</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #1: מִתְקַטְּלִים">FR1</abbr>) and
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Ps 137:1" title="Ps 137:1">עַ֥ל־נַהֲר֨וֹת׀</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #3: מִתְפַּעֲלִים">FR3</abbr>). But I don’t know whether this
<span class="romanized">merka</span> implies some secondary stress like a
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. Stress-wise, perhaps this <span class="romanized">merka</span>
is as meaningless as a <span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span>. E.g., though
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Ps 94:4" title="Ps 94:4">יִ֝תְאַמְּר֗וּ</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #1: מִתְקַטְּלִים">FR1</abbr>) has
<span class="romanized">geresh muqdam</span> where we would expect a
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, I have no reservations about counting it as an exception,
since if it “wanted” a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> it could have one, as in
<bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Ps 106:35" title="Ps 106:35">וַֽ֝יִּלְמְד֗וּ</bdi>
(<abbr title="fully regular pattern #2: מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים">FR2</abbr>).</p>
