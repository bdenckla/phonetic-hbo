<h1>Ignored phrase in parentheses in <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr> definition</h1>
<p>I define <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr> not only taking my usual liberties with the original text of <abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr> but also going further, by ignoring a phrase in parentheses that appears in the original. The original defines <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr> words as those where “the stress syllable is preceded by a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>&thinsp;—&thinsp;or even a simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>&thinsp;—&thinsp;which separates two identical consonants (or a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> under some other non-guttural letter).” I ignore the phrase “or a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> under some other non-guttural letter.”</p>
<p>I ignore this phrase because I don’t understand it. It seems to be referring to cases like <abbr title="fully regular pattern #3: מִתְפַּעֲלִים">FR3</abbr> or <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #2: הַפּוֹעֲלִים">AFR2</abbr> but with their <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> on a non-guttural rather than a guttural. Although <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> does, in rare cases, appear on a non-guttural, I don’t find it in cases like <abbr title="fully regular pattern #3: מִתְפַּעֲלִים">FR3</abbr> or <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #2: הַפּוֹעֲלִים">AFR2</abbr>.</p>
<p>For completeness, I will note that I do find <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> on a non-guttural in patterns <abbr title="fully regular pattern #1: מִתְקַטְּלִים">FR1</abbr> and <abbr title="fully regular pattern #2: מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים">FR2</abbr>. But I find only 24 such cases, and there is not much diversity among these cases: most are only minor variations of the same thing. E.g. I find six variations of <bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Gen 41:7" title="Gen 41:7">הַֽשִּׁבֳּלִ֔ים</bdi>&thinsp;, all in Genesis 41, and all varying only by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accent.</li>
<li>The presence or absence of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> implied by the accent (present with the four disjunctives and absent with the two conjunctives).</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, I find 13 variations of <bdi lang="hbo" data-bk-ch-vr="@Est 4:4" title="Est 4:4">אֶֽת־מׇרְדֳּכַ֗י</bdi>&thinsp;, all, not surprisingly, in Esther, and all varyingly only by: </p>
<ul>
<li>The factors listed above (accent and <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>).</li>
<li>The use of <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> or <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span> implied by the accent (<span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> with pausal accents and <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span> with the rest).</li>
<li>The prefix, e.g. <bdi>את־</bdi>, <bdi>אל־</bdi>, <bdi>על־</bdi>, <bdi>or ול</bdi>.</li>
</ul>
