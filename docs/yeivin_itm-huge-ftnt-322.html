<h1>AFR vs. FR tendency to use the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span></h1>
<p>My research disagrees with this claim that, compared to FR disjunctives, AFR disjunctives show
only slightly less tendency to use the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. Of course it
is hard to quantitatively define what “slightly” means, but for any reasonable definition, my
research disagrees with this claim. To be fair to
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>, we should exclude
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #2: הַפּוֹעֲלִים">AFR2</abbr> and
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #3: מִתְבָּרְכִים">AFR3</abbr> from the broader claim
about AFR words in general. We should exclude them for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>For pattern <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #2: הַפּוֹעֲלִים">AFR2</abbr>,
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr> warns that the
number of exceptions is “much greater” than among FR words.</li>
<li>For pattern <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #3: מִתְבָּרְכִים">AFR3</abbr>,
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr> gives the even
stronger warning that <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is “generally not marked,” even
underlining that phrase.</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of these warnings, it is odd that
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr> makes this broad
claim about AFR words. We shall give
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr> the benefit of the
doubt by assuming that it meant to make a less-broad claim that included only
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #1">AFR1</abbr> and
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr>.</p>
<p>While I find that about 6% of FR disjunctives (130 out of 2174) lack the expected
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, I find the following for
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #1">AFR1</abbr> and
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find that about 19% of <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #1">AFR1</abbr> disjunctives
(20 out of 106) lack the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. Although this shows that
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #1">AFR1</abbr> shares FR1’s tendency to use the expected
<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, it shows that
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #1">AFR1</abbr> has more than slightly less of this
tendency.</li>
<li>I find that about 60% of <abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr> disjunctives
(63 out of 105) lack the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. This is just plain
inconsistent with the claim made by
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. This is a
disagreement in kind rather than degree. Since I find that more than half of the disjunctives lack
the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, I could say that
<abbr title="almost fully regular pattern #4">AFR4</abbr> has a mild tendency to <em>not</em> use
the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on disjunctives!</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to do further research to understand these discrepancies between my results and the claims
in <abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>. In a long
footnote in <a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#ns320" data-num-of-sec="320">#320</a> I include many
possible sources of such discrepancies.</p>
<p>Finally, I should note that I have assumed that
<abbr title="Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah" class="small-caps">ITM</abbr>’s claim is about
the expected <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on disjunctives, but, technically, the claim is
not restricted to disjunctives. The claim is, literally: “Words in this category [(AFR)] show
slightly less tendency to[wards] the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> than words with
fully regular structure.” If I test an accent-ignoring version of this claim, I find that about 63%
of FR words have the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> expected mainly on disjunctives, about the
same (65%) is true for AFR1, and AFR4 is once again wildly different, with only about 32% of words
having that <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. (I decline to go so far as to assess a version of
this claim in which we also ignore where the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> appears, although,
technically, the claim is not restricted to the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on the main
part of the syllable that is two before the stress.)</p>
