<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-375">375</h3>
<p>Masoretic treatises, such as the <span class="romanized">Kitāb al-Khilaf</span> (<span class="romanized">Sefer ha-Ḥillufim</span>), the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span>, the “Treatise on the <span class="romanized">Shewa</span>”, and the <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span>, naturally deal with matters of vocalization. These are outside the scope of this book, but two phenomena, <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> and <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, form such an important part of the subject matter of such treatises that it seems advisable to include a discussion of them in an appendix. It must be noted, however, that they are discussed here from the point of view of the masoretic treatises, which is different from that of modern grammarians, so that statements made here may conflict with those of modern grammars (and particularly introductory grammars), which are based on historical considerations.</p>
