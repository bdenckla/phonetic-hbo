<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-375">375</h3>
<p>Masoretic treatises such as the following naturally deal with matters of vocalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <span class="romanized">Kitāb al-Khilaf</span> (<span class="romanized">Sefer
ha-Ḥillufim</span>)</li>
<li>the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span></li>
<li>the “Treatise on the <span class="romanized">Shewa</span>”</li>
<li>the <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are outside the scope of this book, but two phenomena,
<span class="romanized">dagesh</span> and <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, form such an
important part of the subject matter of such treatises that it seems advisable to include a
discussion of them in an appendix. It must be noted, however, that they are discussed here from the
point of view of the masoretic treatises, which is different from that of modern grammarians. So,
statements made here may conflict with modern grammars (particularly introductory grammars), since
statements made here are based on historical considerations.</p>
