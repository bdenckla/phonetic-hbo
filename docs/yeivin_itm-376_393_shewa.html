<h1><span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-376">376</h3>
<p>The distinction of silent from vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was a great concern for the Masoretes for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This was necessary for correct pronunciation, since vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was realized as an ultra-short vowel, but silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as no vowel.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> acted as a guide to the syllable structure of the word. Neither type of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was considered to form a syllable. Rather, both types of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> were considered to be dependent on an adjacent “full vowel”; silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the preceding vowel, and vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the following vowel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus in <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁכְּנוּ</span> (Gen 25:18) the silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span> goes with what precedes, and the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> goes with what follows, so that the word is divided <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁ-כְּנוּ</span>.</p>
<p>And in <span lang="hbo">וְהָאֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִים</span> (Est 9:3), which has vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s <span lang="hbo">וְהאחשדרפְנים</span>, the syllabic structure is <span lang="hbo">וְהָ-אֲחַשְׁ-דַּרְ-פְּנִים</span> (<span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>, like simple vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, depends on (belongs to the syllable of) the following vowel).</p>
<p>Phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357_phon_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-346" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="346">#346</a>) could change silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> to vocal, and so change the syllabic structure of a word. The word <span lang="hbo">וּזְהַב</span> without <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is divided <span lang="hbo">וּזְ-הַב</span>, but with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (Gen 2:12) it becomes <span lang="hbo">וּֽ-זְהַב</span>. In the same way at the end of a word, silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (whether marked or only potential) marks the division. In <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא</span> (Gen 1:1), if the potential <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">tav</span> were vocal, the division would be <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵא-שִׁי-תְבָּ-רָא</span>.</p>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (i): The General Rule</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-377">377</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The only exception to this is found in the forms of <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּיִם</span>. Here the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent, a pronunciation made possible among the Tiberians (according to some sources, e.g. Levi, 1936, p. ט, translation p. 8*) by the use of a helping vowel, as <span lang="hbo">אֶשְׁתַּיִם</span>. This helping vowel was evidently the source of the disagreement over the accentuation of the word when it has <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> with no preceding conjunctive (Lev 23:17, Ez 1:11,two times in Ez 41:24). Those who pronounced this initial helping vowel as a full vowel considered that the word was not stressed on its first syllable, so that the $pashta sign was required, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּ֙יִם֙</span>. Those who did not pronounce the helping vowel as a full vowel considered the word as stressed on its first syllable, and so marked it with $yetiv (<a href="yeivin_itm-207_285.html#yeivin-numbered-section-248" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="248">#248</a>). Even in this there was disagreement, however, as bA put the $yetiv in its normal, prepositive position, before the $shewa, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֚תַּיִם</span> (so $ms_aleppo, $ms_leningrad), while bN put it after, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֤תַּיִם</span>, as one would expect for a $mehuppakh not a $yetiv.</p>
