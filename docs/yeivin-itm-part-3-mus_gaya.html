<h1>Musical <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-318">318</h3>
<p>The names “heavy <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” and “light <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (געיה כבדה and געיה קלה) for the two basic categories of musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> were introduced by Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan, and were, as Dotan has remarked, an unfortunate innovation. Dotan, in his edition of the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> uses the terms “small <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” and “great <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (געיה קטנה and געיה גדולה), terms which are used in the Masorah. These terms are not appropriate either, for although in the Masorah the term “small <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” is used for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable, it may also include <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable, and it seems quite likely that the term “great <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” in the Masorah refers to an accent. For this reason the descriptive names “<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable” and “<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable” are used here.</p>
<h2><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on a Closed Syllable</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-319">319</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline">Regular Structure</span>. A word of the same structure as <span lang="hbo">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span>, which has a closed syllable, separated from the stress syllable by another (the “buffer” syllable) followed by vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (simple or <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>&thinsp;) is said to have “regular” structure. In words of such structure, the initial closed syllable has <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> if the word has a disjunctive accent, as <span lang="hbo">נִֽתְחַכְּמָ֖ה</span> (Ex 1:10). In the pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span>, the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> stands under a letter with <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> “forte” (follows a doubled consonant). It may also be the second of two <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s, in a form of pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים</span>, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽכַּרְמְלִֽי</span> (1S 30:5), or a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> in a form of pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְפַּעֲלִים</span> as <span lang="hbo">מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֖ים</span> (Gen 37:9).

<p>This category of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is mentioned in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan, 1967, section 15). An expanded statement is given in the <span class="romanized">Qunṭrese ha-Masorah</span>, as indicated in the notes there, and in Yeivin, 1968, p. 96.</p>
<h2>“Fully Regular” Structure</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-320">320</h3>
<p>Words of the patterns described in <a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-mus_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319">#319</a> are said to have “fully regular” structure. If a word of this structure has a disjunctive accent, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is generally marked, but if the accent is conjunctive, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is generally not marked. This general rule holds good in about 90% of the cases but there are exceptions. In a few dozen cases the accent is disjunctive, but <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is not marked, as</p>

<h2>“Not Fully Regular” Structure</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-322">322</h3>
<p>Words with patterns similar to those described in <a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-mus_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319">#319</a> but showing slight differences in structure, are said to be of “not fully regular” structure. Words in this category show slightly less tendency to use <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> than words with fully regular structure. The following patterns are included in this category:-</p>
<p>1) Where the closed syllable is followed by a vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>1C 2:3</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֑ית</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ex 16:23</td><td><span lang="hbo">אֲשֶֽׁר־תְּבַשְּׁלוּ֙</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>2) Where the “buffer” syllable has a long vowel, such as <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span>, followed by a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> as</p>
<table>

<p>Words with patterns like <span lang="hbo">הַפּוֹעֲלִים</span> (as <span lang="hbo">הַכֹּהֲנִים</span>, <span lang="hbo">הַשֹּׁעֲרִים</span>, etc.) usually do not have <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> and in general the number of exceptions to the rule in this category is much greater than among words with fully regular structure.</p>
<p>3) Where the “buffer” syllable has a long vowel, followed by simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (as in <span lang="hbo">מִתְבָּרְכִים</span>) <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is <span class="yeivin-underline">generally not marked</span>. There are, however, a few exceptions, as</p>

<tr><td>Lev 19:5</td><td><span lang="hbo">לִֽרְצֹנְכֶ֖ם</span></td><td>(and elsewhere)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2S 5:1</td><td><span lang="hbo">וּֽבְשָׂרְךָ֖</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>4) Where the stress syllable is preceded by a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>—or even a simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>—which separates two identical consonants (or a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> under some other non-guttural letter). If this <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is preceded by a short vowel, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked as in words with fully regular structure, as</p>

<p>If the vowel preceding the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is long, the marking of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> follows the rule given in (2) above, as</p>

<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is sometimes marked on a closed syllable in words of similar structure, but where the stress syllable is not preceded by <span class="romanized">shewa</span> or <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>, but the buffer syllable has, or could have, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.</p>

<p>It would be possible to include words of pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְבָּרְכִים</span> (class 3 in <a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-mus_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-322">#322</a>) in this group, since the buffer syllable could have <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (on an open syllable) in those too.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> in words of regular structure is the most common use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable.</p>
<h2>Non-regular structure</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-324">324</h3>
<p>Words with structure which is not “regular”—that is not patterned like <span lang="hbo">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span> or its variants described above—rarely show <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable, and the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on such words has no fixed rules.</p>
<p>1) In some 15 cases <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the fourth syllable before the accent, as Dt 12:2 <span lang="hbo">אֶֽת־כׇּל־הַמְּקֹמ֞וֹת</span>.</p>
<p>2) In some 200 cases <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the third syllable before the accent. This occurs mainly when the accent is one of the “high” trilled disjunctives (<a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-initial_accents_in_the_21.html#yeivin-numbered-section-195">#195</a>). Thus with</p>

<p>In some 30 cases <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the second syllable before the accent--most commonly on a word with penultimate stress marked with <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span>, as</p>

<p>4) In some 60 cases <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the syllable immediately before the accent. In this position <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is rarely marked for musical reasons. Examples are:-</p>

<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> in this position is usually marked for phonetic reasons (<a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-phon_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-350">#350</a>) and this may be the case even in some of the examples given above.</p>
<h2><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> before <span class="romanized">Paseq</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-325">325</h3>
<p>This is most commonly found in cases like 1K 2:30 <span lang="hbo">וַיֹּ֥אמֶֽר&nbsp;׀&nbsp;לֹ֖א</span>, where it is evidently used to mark a separation between the two words greater than that indicated by the <span class="romanized">paseq</span>. <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is only marked in this position in early MSS, and is rare even there.</p>
<h2><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on an Open Syllable, or a syllable with a Long Vowel before <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-326">326</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> may be marked on an open syllable with either a long or a short vowel, and also on a syllable marked with a long vowel before <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. This is the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> called “light” by Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan, and “great” by Dotan. The Masoretes regarded <span class="romanized">shewa</span> after a long vowel within a word as silent (לא יצא בפה see <a href="yeivin-itm-part-4-shewa.html#yeivin-numbered-section-386">#386</a>) so that in a word like <span lang="hbo">קָֽטְלוּ</span> the syllable marked by <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is, in their view, closed, not open. However because the rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in this situation are similar to those for its use on an open syllable, the two situations are described together. Note, however, that two different types of syllable are involved.</p>
<p>This section, then, describes the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (i) on an open syllable before a full vowel, as <span lang="hbo">אָֽנֹכִ֖י</span> (ii) on an open syllable before a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> as <span lang="hbo">שָֽׁאֲלָ֖ה</span> and <span lang="hbo">יַֽעֲמֹ֖ד</span> (iii) on a syllable with a long vowel before a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as <span lang="hbo">קָֽטְלוּ</span>. The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these cases is not affected by the accent on the word. It occurs both with disjunctive and conjunctive accents. Thus:-</p>

<p>If a word contains two syllables which are open, or contain a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, and so are suitable for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, and these come one after the other, then <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is usually marked on the one close to the accent in preference to the other, as</p>

<p>However if the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> farther from the accent is on a word joined with <span class="romanized">maqqef</span>, and so preserves something of the original main stress of that word, then this further <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is given preference over the nearer one in the MSS, as</p>

<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-331">331</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on an open syllable, or after a long vowel followed by a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is the most common category of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the Bible, and occurs in thousands of words. In the early MSS, this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is not marked on all the words where it could be, but only on some of them, and in some MSS it is marked more commonly than in others. It seems probably that it was not considered important to mark it—possibly because it made less difference to the pronunciation of the word than did <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable.</p>
<p>In <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span>, this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is most commonly marked on words with <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> or <span class="romanized">zaqef</span>, less commonly on those with other disjunctives, and only rarely on words with conjunctives. It is marked in about 30% of the possible cases.</p>
<p>In <span title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">L</span> and <span title="Sasoon 507">S</span> it is marked in about 40% of the possible cases. In <span title="British Museum MS Or. 4445 (see section #31)">B</span> and <span title="Sasoon 1053">S<sup>1</sup></span> it is marked in about 20% of the possible cases. In <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span> this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked much more commonly—in about 75% of the possible cases.</p>
<p>The other early MSS mark this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in varying proportions of the possible cases. It is not always true that earlier MSS mark it less, as is shown by <span title="British Museum MS Or. 4445 (see section #31)">B</span> and <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span>, which are roughly contemporary. It is, however, generally true that later MSS mark this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> more commonly, and the printed texts mark <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable regularly on every syllable suitable for it.</p>

<h2><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> with <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-333">333</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> marked with <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (or a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>&thinsp;) at the beginning of a word indicates (as elsewhere) that the syllable must be slowed or lengthened. Consequently that <span class="romanized">shewa</span> becomes a vowel—probably equivalent to an ordinary short vowel. This <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is rare in the twenty one books (only some 200 cases occur) but it is common in the three books. This is a musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, but it is often used with <span class="romanized">shewa</span> before a guttural, which suggests that there may be phonetic reasons for its use. The system of marking it is similar to that for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable, but there are no firm rules for its use.</p>
<p>This <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the second, third, or fourth syllable before the accent. It is usually used with “high” accents (<a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-initial_accents_in_the_21.html#yeivin-numbered-section-195">#195</a>), and so with <span class="romanized">geresh</span>.</p>

<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> with <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is regularly marked in early MSS but the rules for it are not described in early sources, nor even by Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan. Heidenheim and Baer were the first to establish these rules. The pronunciation of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is described in the masoretic literature (as in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Baer-Strack 1879, #11)—see also Morag, 1963, p. 160 ff.). They state that <span class="romanized">shewa</span> at the beginning of a word was generally pronounced as a small <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span> (פתחה קטנה) but that when it was marked with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> it was pronounced like a full <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span> (בפתחה גדולה תצא). Before gutturals, the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was pronounced as a short vowel of the same quality as the vowel following the guttural, but when it was marked with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> it had the sound of a full vowel of that quality (thus <span lang="hbo">בְּֽהֹנוֹת֩</span> Jud 1:7 would be pronounced with three <span class="romanized">ḥolem</span> s). <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> at the beginning of a word before <span class="romanized">yod</span> was pronounced like a short <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>, but when marked with a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, it was pronounced like a full <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>.</p>

In the last situation, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> may be marked before either a disjunctive or a conjunctive accent.</p>
<p>This <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked regularly in most printed texts, but in MSS it is usually marked only if the closed syllable with the long vowel stands immediately before the stress syllable,  as</p>

<p>In general the marking of this <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the early MSS is more regular than the marking of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable, but less regular than the marking of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable of the “regular” type. However the regularity varies from MS to MS.</p>

<h2>The System of Preference for Musical <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-339">339</h3>
<p>In early MSS, such as <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span>, <span title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">L</span>, <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span>, two <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s are only rarely marked on the same word (or on a group of words joined by <span class="romanized">maqqef</span>&thinsp;). Where a word or word group could have more than one <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, only one of them is generally marked as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Ezra 9:12</td><td><span lang="hbo">בְּֽנוֹתֵיכֶ֞ם</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Jer 31:20</td><td><span lang="hbo">אֲֽרַחֲמֶ֖נּוּ</span></td><td>(31:18 or 19 in some editions)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>where <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked under the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> but not in the following open syllable, or Ex 15:26 <span lang="hbo">כׇּֽל־הַמַּחֲלָ֞ה</span>, where <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the initial closed syllable (a “non-regular” type) is marked, while that of the regular type, under the <span class="romanized">he</span>, is not. Contrariwise, in <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span> in 2K 23:12 <span lang="hbo">וְאֶת־הַֽמִּזְבְּח֡וֹת</span>, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable of the regular type is marked, while that of the non-regular type, under the <span class="romanized">alef</span> and <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> with the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, are not. (The <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> with the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was marked by bN.)</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-340">340</h3>
<p>The choice of which of two or more <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s should be marked under a word is determined by certain general principles, although these are affected by many detailed considerations which cannot be described here. The basic principle is that <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable is given preference over <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable, or <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> after a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. Examples are:-</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Jud 18:12</td><td><span lang="hbo">וַֽיַּעֲל֗וּ</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Jud 19:29</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמַּאֲכֶ֙לֶת֙</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on the initial closed syllable (of the regular type) is marked, but that on the following open syllable (before the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>&thinsp;) is not. So also</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Dt 31:20</td><td><span lang="hbo">אֶֽל־הָאֲדָמָ֣ה׀</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nu 17:21</td><td><span lang="hbo">כׇּֽל־נְשִׂיאֵיהֶ֡ם</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Here <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked on the initial closed syllable of non-regular type, but not on the following open syllable. This general principle is common to all the early MSS.</p>
<p>On the problem of preference in words which could have more than one <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable (or on a syllable with a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>) see <a href="yeivin-itm-part-3-mus_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-328">#328</a>.</p>

<h2>The Marking of <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> in Manuscripts and Printed Texts</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-342">342</h3>
<p>In early MSS, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable of regular or non-regular type, and <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> with <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, are usually carefully and accurately marked. In some MSS this is also the case with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable with a long vowel. MSS following this system show the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system of marking these <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s is generally consistent throughout the MS.</li>
<li>The system of marking these <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s is similar in different MSS. That is, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is generally marked in the same position on the same word in nearly all MSS.</li>
<li>Variations involving <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> noted in lists of <span class="romanized">ḥillufim</span> or in marginal notes in the MSS are almost solely concerned with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics show the importance to the Masoretes of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories, as opposed to <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in an open syllable (or after a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>). The lesser importance of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these latter categories is also shown by the fact that</p>
<ol>
<li>The system of marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable (or after a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>) is not consistent in any single MS.</li>
<li>The early MSS do not share the same system for marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories, and they show no uniformity in the words on which <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories is marked.</li>
<li>Lists of <span class="romanized">ḥillufim</span> are almost bare of examples of variants involving <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-343">343</h3>
<p>In later MSS and in printed texts, a different system of marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is used. In printed texts, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable (or after a long vowel followed by <span class="romanized">shewa</span>) is generally consistently and systematically marked, but <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable is marked only sporadically, or not at all.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-344">344</h3>
<p>This difference is reflected in the system of preference for marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>. If a word could have <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> both on a closed syllable and on an open syllable, that on the open syllable is marked in printed text, as Ex 14:19 <span lang="hbo">וַיַּֽעֲמֹ֖ד</span> whereas that on the closed syllable would be marked in early MSS, i.e. <span lang="hbo">וַֽיַּעֲמֹ֖ד</span>.</p>
<p>In a number of scholarly editions, such as those of Baer, Heidenheim, Qoren (Koren), and others, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> as completely as possible, so that both <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s are marked in a word like <span lang="hbo" class="extra-letter-spacing">וַֽיַּֽעֲמֹ֖ד</span>. Similar usage is found in a number of MSS, as noted by Eliahu ha-Levi in his <span class="romanized">Ṭuv Ṭaʿam</span> chapter 7:</p>
<blockquote><p>When there is <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> in the second letter of a word, and this letter is followed by <bdi>א</bdi>, <bdi>ה</bdi>, <bdi>ח</bdi>, <bdi>or ע</bdi> pointed with <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>, then that word has two <span class="romanized">metheg</span> s: one on the first letter — the principal <span class="romanized">metheg</span>, one on the letter before the guttural—but only if the word has a disjunctive accent, as <span lang="hbo" class="extra-letter-spacing">וַֽיַּֽעֲמֹד</span> and <span lang="hbo" class="extra-letter-spacing">וַֽיַּֽעֲבֹד</span>.</p>
