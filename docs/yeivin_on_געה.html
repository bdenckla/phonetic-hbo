<h2 class="yeivin">‘$G’ on a Closed Syllable</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-319">319</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline">Regular Structure</span>. A word of the same structure as $מתקטלים, which as a closed syllable, separated from the stress syllable by another (the "buffer" syllable) followed by vocal $shewa (simple or $ḥatef) is said to have "regular" structure. In words of such structure, the initial closed syllable has $g if the word has a disjunctive accent, as xxx. In the pattern xxx, the vocal $shewa stands under a letter with $dagesh "forte" (follows a doubled consonant). It may also be the second of two $shewas, in a form of pattern xxx, as xxx (1S 30:5), or a $ḥatef_shewa in a form of pattern xxx as xxx (Gen 37:9). Further exampels are:-</p>
