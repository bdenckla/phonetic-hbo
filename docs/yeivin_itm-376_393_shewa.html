<h1><span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-376">376</h3>
<p>The distinction of silent from vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was a great concern for the Masoretes for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This was necessary for correct pronunciation, since vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was realized as an ultra-short vowel, but silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as no vowel.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> acted as a guide to the syllable structure of the word. Neither type of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was considered to form a syllable. Rather, both types of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> were considered to be dependent on an adjacent “full vowel”; silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the preceding vowel, and vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the following vowel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus in <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁכְּנוּ</span> (Gen 25:18) the silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span> goes with what precedes, and the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> goes with what follows, so that the word is divided <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁ-כְּנוּ</span>.</p>
<p>And in <span lang="hbo">וְהָאֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִים</span> (Est 9:3), which has vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s <span lang="hbo">וְהאחשדרפְנים</span>, the syllabic structure is <span lang="hbo">וְהָ-אֲחַשְׁ-דַּרְ-פְּנִים</span> (<span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>, like simple vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, depends on (belongs to the syllable of) the following vowel).</p>
<p>Phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357_phon_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-346" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="346">#346</a>) could change silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> to vocal, and so change the syllabic structure of a word. The word <span lang="hbo">וּזְהַב</span> without <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is divided <span lang="hbo">וּזְ-הַב</span>, but with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (Gen 2:12) it becomes <span lang="hbo">וּֽ-זְהַב</span>. In the same way at the end of a word, silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (whether marked or only potential) marks the division. In <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא</span> (Gen 1:1), if the potential <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">tav</span> were vocal, the division would be <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵא-שִׁי-תְבָּ-רָא</span>.</p>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (i): The General Rule</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-377">377</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The only exception to this is found in the forms of <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּיִם</span>. Here the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent, a pronunciation made possible among the Tiberians (according to some sources, e.g. Levi, 1936, p. ט, translation p. 8*) by the use of a helping vowel, as <span lang="hbo">אֶשְׁתַּיִם</span>. This helping vowel was evidently the source of the disagreement over the accentuation of the word when it has <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> with no preceding conjunctive (Lev 23:17, Ez 1:11, two times in Ez 41:24). Those who pronounced this initial helping vowel as a full vowel considered that the word was not stressed on its first syllable, so that the <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> sign was required, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּ֙יִם֙</span>. Those who did not pronounce the helping vowel as a full vowel considered the word as stressed on its first syllable, and so marked it with <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-207_285.html#yeivin-numbered-section-248" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="248">#248</a>). Even in this there was disagreement, however, as bA put the <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> in its normal, prepositive position, before the <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֚תַּיִם</span> (so <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr>), while bN put it after, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֤תַּיִם</span>, as one would expect for a <span class="romanized">mehuppakh</span> not a <span class="romanized">yetiv</span>.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-378">378</h3>
<p>At the end of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent. Most sources also say that when two <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s come together at the end of a word, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּ֣בְךְּ עֲלֵהֶ֑ם</span> (Gen 45:15), both are silent. However some sources state that the first is silent and the second vocal, unless the word occurs at a major pause, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּֽבְךְּ</span> (Gen 29:11), in which case all agree that both are silent.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-379">379</h3>
<p>Within a word, where <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is marked on two successive letters, the first is silent and the second vocal. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under a letter marked with <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> is vocal. Apart from these two clear cases, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> within a word is consider silent, with the exception of several special categories of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> which are noted in various masoretic sources.</p>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> below <span class="romanized">resh</span></span>. The Masorah gives rules on the subject of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span>, but these are not the same in different sources. It is said that in nouns, if <span class="romanized">resh</span> is the second letter, and has <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> or <span class="romanized">ṣere</span> before it, then <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Ex 8:11</td><td><span lang="hbo">הָרְוָחָ֔ה</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ex 19:2</td><td><span lang="hbo">מֵרְפִידִ֗ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>If it has <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> or <span class="romanized">ḥolem</span> before it, however, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as </p>
<table>
<tr><td>Jud 19:17</td><td><span lang="hbo">בִּרְחֹ֣ב</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Jud 9:37</td><td><span lang="hbo">יוֹרְדִ֔ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Rules on <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> in verb forms are given for particular roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>גרשׁ – If there is a <span class="romanized">segol</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span>, then <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Ex 23:30 <span lang="hbo">אֲגָרְשֶׁ֖נּוּ</span>. Otherwise the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent, as Jud 11:2 <span lang="hbo">וַיְגָרְשׁ֣וּ</span>, with the exception of Ps 34:1 <span lang="hbo">וַ֝יְגָרְשֵׁ֗הוּ</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shin</span> has <span class="romanized">ṣere</span>, but the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal in the opinion of bA (although bN considers it silent).</li>
<li>ברך – If the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">bet</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as 1C 29:20 <span lang="hbo">בָּ֥רְכוּ נָ֖א</span>. If the accent is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Gen 27:34 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֥נִי</span>, with the exception of Dan 4:31 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֔ת</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent even though the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 21)).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> is considered vocal also in Gen 18:21 <span lang="hbo">אֵֽרְדָה־נָּ֣א</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span>), Ps 83:13 <span lang="hbo">נִ֣ירְשָׁה לָּ֑נוּ</span> (given as a case of agreement between bA and bN), and, according to bA, Job 31:37 <span lang="hbo">אֲקָֽרְבֶֽנּוּ</span>, where <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> and <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> have <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>. However, bN considers the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> silent in this last case.</p>
