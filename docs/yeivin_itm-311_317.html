<h1>Initial Remarks on <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h1>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-311">311</h3>
<p>Some information on <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is included in the rules on the accents given in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, sections 14, 15, 20, and elsewhere). The statements on <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the masoretic literature and the works of the early grammarians are few and unsystematic. The most detailed treatment of the rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is that given by Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan (published in Gumpertz, 1958). It was Yequtiʾel who set up different categories of the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, introduced the terms “light <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable) and “heavy <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable).</p>
<p>The survey of rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the <span class="romanized">Miqneh Abram</span> of Abram di Balmes, and in Heidenheim’s <span class="romanized">Sefer Mispeṭe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (45a–60b) was based on those of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan. Eliahu ha-Levi also gives detailed rules on the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>&thinsp;—&thinsp;though less systematic than those of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan&thinsp;—&thinsp;in <span class="romanized">Ṭuv Ṭaʿam</span> chapter 7. The same is true of Shelomo Yedidyah Norzi’s <span class="romanized">Maʾamar ha-Maʾarik</span>.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive survey of the rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is that in Baer 1869. These rules were derived from the study of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in late manuscripts, and in some cases Baer imposes a system where none is evident in his sources. Nevertheless, Baer’s rules were adopted in scholarly grammars, such as Bergsträsser 1918 (vol. 1, #11).</p>
<p>A few surveys of the system of marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in early manuscripts have been published. The system used in <abbr title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">MsC</abbr> is briefly described in Hartom, 1952. The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in several manuscripts is briefly described in Greenspan, 1961. A detailed description of the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> is given in Yeivin, 1968, p. 19–194 (on the 21 books) and p. 241–277 (on the three books).</p>
<h2>The Name <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-312">312</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> (&thinsp;<bdi lang="hbo">גַעְיָה</bdi> or <bdi lang="hbo">גִיעְיָה</bdi>&thinsp;) is the older name for this sign (a short vertical stroke under the word), and is used in the masoretic literature. The absence of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is called <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>, as in the masorah magna of <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> at Prov 4:16:</p>
<blockquote><p>איוב <bdi lang="hbo">לֹא יִשְׁנוּ</bdi> חטף משלי <bdi lang="hbo">לֹא יִֽשְׁנוּ</bdi> געי</p>
<p>Job <bdi lang="hbo">לֹא יִשְׁנוּ</bdi> has no <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>; Proverbs <bdi lang="hbo">לֹא יִֽשְׁנוּ</bdi> has <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(“Job” implicitly refers to 29:22; “Proverbs” refers to the location of this note: 4:16.) (Note that the word ישנו has a different meaning in the two cases.) <span class="romanized">Metheg</span> (&thinsp;<bdi lang="hbo">מֶתֶג</bdi>&thinsp;), the later name for the sign, and that common today, is first known from the work of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan (first half of the thirteenth century). Eliahu ha-Levi (beginning of the sixteenth century) already suggests that <span class="romanized">metheg</span> is the correct term, and that <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> was only a name for one of the classes of <span class="romanized">metheg</span> (that with <span class="romanized">shewa</span>).</p>
<h2>The <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> Sign</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-313">313</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is a short vertical stroke under the word (generally on a syllable before the main stress syllable, on which most accent signs are marked). In printed texts the stroke is really vertical, and this is also the case in most manuscripts, but in some manuscripts it is slanted a little counterclockwise from the vertical, like <span class="romanized">ṭifḥa</span> (to distinguish it from <span class="romanized">merka</span>, which is slanted clockwise from the vertical). In the <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span> it is said that bA and bN use this slanted form of the sign, but it is characteristic of only a few early manuscripts.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> forms part of the accent system, and is generally marked only in manuscripts in which the accent signs are marked, and not in those which mark only vowel signs. <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is not easily confused with a word’s primary accent sign, even if that sign is <span class="romanized">silluq</span>. This is because <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is generally marked before the stress syllable, while most primary accent signs are marked on the stress syllable. In manuscripts that are not scrupulous about stroke angles, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> can be easily confused with a <span class="romanized">merka</span> used as a secondary accent.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-314">314</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is generally written to the left of (“after”) a vowel sign marked under the same letter. In some manuscripts, such as <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> and <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr>, this convention is carefully maintained, with very few exceptions&thinsp;—&thinsp;and those usually due to correction, or to lack of space in the regular position. In other manuscripts, such as <abbr title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">MsC</abbr>, <abbr title="Sasoon 507">MsS</abbr>, <abbr title="Sasoon 1053">MsS1</abbr>, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is often written to the right of the vowel sign, without any particular reason. <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is also generally written to the left of the simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> sign, but there are manuscripts in which it is often written to the right. The same is generally true of <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> signs, but in some manuscripts, such as <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> and <abbr title="Sasoon 1053">MsS1</abbr>, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> may be written between the two parts of the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> sign; <bdi lang="hbo">אאֲ‍ֽא</bdi>. This does not occur in <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> and <abbr title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">MsC</abbr>.</p>
<h2>The Function of <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-315">315</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> has no musical motif of its own, but indicates that the reading of its syllable is to be slowed down, and not slurred over, as noted in <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span> p. 77 (Dérenbourg, 1870, p. 385):</p>
<blockquote><p>But <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, which has the form of a stroke inclined backwards, and is found under some words, is neither a disjunctive nor a conjunctive accent, but indicates that the syllable must be lengthened a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Above, we assume “backwards” means “counterclockwise from the vertical.” See <a href="yeivin_itm-311_317.html#yeivin-numbered-section-313" data-num-of-sec="313">#313</a>.)</p>
<p>It is probable that this slowing down of the reading of the syllable is the main function of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, not the raising or trilling of the tone. It is possible however, that, as time went on, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> came to be viewed as a secondary accent, and the rules for its use were changed, so that it came to be read with a raising of the pitch, and a short motif of its own.</p>
<h2>The Categories of <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-316">316</h3>
<p>The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> can be divided into two groups of categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="yeivin-pseudo-heading">Musical</span>: Categories determined by the needs of the Biblical chant. The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories is dependent on the syllabic structure of the word, and dependent on the accent on that word or the accent on its neighbors. Most examples of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> belong in these musical categories.</li>
<li><span class="yeivin-pseudo-heading">Phonetic</span>: Categories dependent on the letters and vowels of the word or its neighbors. Few examples of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> belong in these phonetic categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not always possible to determine whether <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is used for a musical or phonetic reason. In some cases the reason could be either musical or phonetic, but this is of no importance. Whatever the reason for using <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, its function is always the same: to slow the reading of the syllable, whether this is required for musical reasons at the beginning of a particular motif, or for phonetic reasons, to ensure the clear pronunciation of all the sounds of a word.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-317">317</h3>
<p>The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in different sources differs greatly. In general, most categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> are not marked consistently in manuscripts, while in printed texts a number of categories are marked systematically. For the study of the early manuscripts it is most important to note the categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> which are mentioned in masoretic treatises, and those mentioned in the <span class="romanized">Sefer ha-Ḥillufim</span>, since the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is the area in which bA and bN differ most frequently. The categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Musical.<ol>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable (“small” or “heavy” <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>) in a word the structure of which can be either “regular” or “non-regular.”</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on an open syllable (“great” or “light” <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>).</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on a <span class="romanized">maqqef</span>-closed, long-vowelled syllable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Phonetic.<ol>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used to render a following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> vocal.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used on account of a guttural.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used in the roots היה and חיה.</li>
</ol>
</li>
