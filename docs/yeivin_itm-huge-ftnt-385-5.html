<h1>D1 often</h1>
<p>How did Yeivin determine that Rule D1 is not obeyed in manuscripts in which vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
is <em>often</em> made explicit? To answer that question, we first need to know: what does it even
mean for this rule to be obeyed in such manuscripts? I ask this second, more basic question because
in my interpretation at least, this rule’s purpose is to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the
“vocality” of simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, but in many cases these manuscripts have
no such ambiguity, due to their use of <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>.</p>
<p>In words where a vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> sound is already explicitly called
for, i.e. in words where <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is used, it is in some sense
“unfair” to expect a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> to redundantly call for a vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
sound. So it is not surprising that, as Yeivin documents here and elsewhere, we don’t consistently
find such redundancy. </p>
<p>The more interesting words are ones in which only simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is
used. In such words, the question becomes: which of the following is true?</p>
<ol>
<li>Does simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> mean silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
in all (or at least most) of these words?</li>
<li>Or, is simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> ambiguous in these words, as it is in
manuscripts that rarely make vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> explicit?</li>
</ol>
<p>As Yeivin documents here and elsewhere, unfortunately the answer is number 2: although in these
manuscripts <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is often used to unambiguously notate a vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
sound, simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is still used ambiguously in these manuscripts in
the circumstances under discussion: on the <abbr title="first [of an] identical pair [of letters]" class="small-caps">FIP</abbr>.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the basic question of what Yeivin means when he says that Rule D1 is not obeyed
in manuscripts in which vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is often made explicit. What he
means, initially at least, is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Unfair” or not, for words with <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>, he means that Rule D1 is
not obeyed because the redundant <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is sometimes absent. The
relevant examples here are <bdi lang="hbo">נְגַשֲׁשָׁ֤ה</bdi> and <bdi lang="hbo">שֹׁדֲדִ֛ים</bdi>.</li>
<li>For words with simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, he means that Rule D1 is not obeyed
because sometimes <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is present. The relevant example here is <bdi lang="hbo">לְשִֽׁמְמ֥וֹת</bdi>.<ul>
<li>It is somewhat strange to say that Rule D1 is not obeyed in such cases.</li>
<li>Rule D1 is not obeyed only if we assume, temporarily, that simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
means silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> in such words.</li>
<li>It is fine to make such assumptions, temporarily, for the purposes of argument, and indeed that
is I think what Yeivin is doing, but he does not make that clear.</li>
<li>Yeivin does an external consistency check on <bdi lang="hbo">לְשִֽׁמְמ֥וֹת</bdi>, using the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>
of <abbr title="Leningrad Firkowitsch II.9 (see section #51)">μL20</abbr> to determine that the simple
<span class="romanized">shewa</span> of <bdi lang="hbo">לְשִֽׁמְמ֥וֹת</bdi> is likely vocal. On that
basis, <bdi lang="hbo">לְשִֽׁמְמ֥וֹת</bdi> obeys D1!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So Yeivin’s examples merely show that manuscripts like <abbr title="Aleppo Codex (see section #26)">μA</abbr>
don’t obey D1 “naively,” by which I mean that they don’t obey D1 assuming that simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
means silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. But, the real question is whether Rule D1 is
obeyed in these words <em>without</em> assuming that simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
means silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. The answer is that Rule D1 is not obeyed in that
way either. Yeivin implicitly provides that answer when he goes on to give Rule D2.</p>
