<h1><span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-376">376</h3>
<p>The distinction of silent from vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was a great concern for the Masoretes for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This was necessary for correct pronunciation, since vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was realized as an ultra-short vowel, but silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as no vowel.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> acted as a guide to the syllable structure of the word. Neither type of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was considered to form a syllable. Rather, both types of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> were considered to be dependent on an adjacent “full vowel”; silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the preceding vowel, and vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the following vowel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus in <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁכְּנוּ</span> (Gen 25:18) the silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span> goes with what precedes, and the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> goes with what follows, so that the word is divided <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁ-כְּנוּ</span>.</p>
<p>And in <span lang="hbo">וְהָאֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִים</span> (Est 9:3), which has vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s <span lang="hbo">וְהאחשדרפְנים</span>, the syllabic structure is <span lang="hbo">וְהָ-אֲחַשְׁ-דַּרְ-פְּנִים</span> (<span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>, like simple vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, depends on (belongs to the syllable of) the following vowel).</p>
<p>Phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-346" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="346">#346</a>) could change silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> to vocal, and so change the syllabic structure of a word. The word <span lang="hbo">וּזְהַב</span> without <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is divided <span lang="hbo">וּזְ-הַב</span>, but with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (Gen 2:12) it becomes <span lang="hbo">וּֽ-זְהַב</span>. In the same way at the end of a word, silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (whether marked or only potential) marks the division. In <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא</span> (Gen 1:1), if the potential <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">tav</span> were vocal, the division would be <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵא-שִׁי-תְבָּ-רָא</span>.</p>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (i): The General Rule</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-377">377</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The only exception to this is found in the forms of <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּיִם</span>. Here the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent, a pronunciation made possible among the Tiberians (according to some sources, e.g. Levi, 1936, p. ט, translation p. 8*) by the use of a helping vowel, as <span lang="hbo">אֶשְׁתַּיִם</span>. This helping vowel was evidently the source of the disagreement over the accentuation of the word when it has <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> with no preceding conjunctive (Lev 23:17, Ez 1:11, two times in Ez 41:24). Those who pronounced this initial helping vowel as a full vowel considered that the word was not stressed on its first syllable, so that the <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> sign was required, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּ֙יִם֙</span>. Those who did not pronounce the helping vowel as a full vowel considered the word as stressed on its first syllable, and so marked it with <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-207_285.html#yeivin-numbered-section-248" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="248">#248</a>). Even in this there was disagreement, however, as bA put the <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> in its normal, prepositive position, before the <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֚תַּיִם</span> (so <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr>), while bN put it after, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֤תַּיִם</span>, as one would expect for a <span class="romanized">mehuppak</span> not a <span class="romanized">yetiv</span>.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-378">378</h3>
<p>At the end of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent. Most sources also say that when two <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s come together at the end of a word, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּ֣בְךְּ עֲלֵהֶ֑ם</span> (Gen 45:15), both are silent. However some sources state that the first is silent and the second vocal, unless the word occurs at a major pause, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּֽבְךְּ</span> (Gen 29:11), in which case all agree that both are silent.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-379">379</h3>
<p>Within a word, where <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is marked on two successive letters, the first is silent and the second vocal. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under a letter marked with <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> is vocal. Apart from these two clear cases, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> within a word is consider silent, with the exception of several special categories of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> which are noted in various masoretic sources.</p>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> below <span class="romanized">resh</span></span>. The Masorah gives rules on the subject of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span>, but these are not the same in different sources. It is said that in nouns, if <span class="romanized">resh</span> is the second letter, and has <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> or <span class="romanized">ṣere</span> before it, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Ex 8:11</td><td><span lang="hbo">הָרְוָחָ֔ה</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ex 19:2</td><td><span lang="hbo">מֵרְפִידִ֗ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>If it has <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> or <span class="romanized">ḥolem</span> before it, however, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as </p>
<table>
<tr><td>Jud 19:17</td><td><span lang="hbo">בִּרְחֹ֣ב</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Jud 9:37</td><td><span lang="hbo">יוֹרְדִ֔ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Rules on <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> in verb forms are given for particular roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>גרשׁ – If there is a <span class="romanized">segol</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span>, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Ex 23:30 <span lang="hbo">אֲגָרְשֶׁ֖נּוּ</span>. Otherwise the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent, as Jud 11:2 <span lang="hbo">וַיְגָרְשׁ֣וּ</span>, with the exception of Ps 34:1 <span lang="hbo">וַ֝יְגָרְשֵׁ֗הוּ</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shin</span> has <span class="romanized">ṣere</span>, but the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal in the opinion of bA (although bN considers it silent).</li>
<li>ברך – If the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">bet</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as 1C 29:20 <span lang="hbo">בָּ֥רְכוּ נָ֖א</span>. If the accent is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Gen 27:34 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֥נִי</span>, with the exception of Dan 4:31 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֔ת</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent even though the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 21)).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> is considered vocal also in Gen 18:21 <span lang="hbo">אֵֽרְדָה־נָּ֣א</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span>), Ps 83:13 <span lang="hbo">נִ֣ירְשָׁה לָּ֑נוּ</span> (given as a case of agreement between bA and bN), and, according to bA, Job 31:37 <span lang="hbo">אֲקָֽרְבֶֽנּוּ</span>, where <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> and <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> have <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>. However, bN considers the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> silent in this last case.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-380">380</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under other letters</span>. The Masorah gives rules for the pronunciation of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> in some other verb forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>אכל – If the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> has a <span class="romanized">segol</span>, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> is vocal as Dt 12:24 <span lang="hbo">תֹּאכְלֶ֑נּוּ</span>. Otherwise the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent as Nu 11:19 <span lang="hbo">תֹּאכְל֖וּן</span>, with the exception of Qoh 5:10 <span lang="hbo">אֹכְלֶ֑יהָ</span> where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent even though the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> has a <span class="romanized">segol</span>. This is stated in <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 22), and is also given in the <span class="romanized">Sefer ha-Ḥillufim</span> as the opinion of bA. However, bN regards the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">kaf</span> as silent in all cases.</li>
<li>הלך – <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> is silent except in the long form of the imperfect where the accent is retracted to the first syllable, and the following word has conjunctive <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-394_416.html#yeivin-numbered-section-405" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="405">#405</a>), as Ex 4:18 <span lang="hbo">אֵ֣לְכָה נָּ֗א</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 25)). (<abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> has <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (ii): Special Cases</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-381">381</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> following Phonetic <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></span>. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> following a short vowel is usually silent, even where this vowel has musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="319">#319</a>). However if the short vowel has phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> intended to show that the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal, it is, of course, vocal. The situation in which phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is used are described above (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-345" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="345">#345</a>). The Masorah gives rules covering some of these situations.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-382">382</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">Mem</span> following <span class="romanized">He</span> with <span class="romanized">Pataḥ</span> at the Beginning of a Word</span>. (cf. <a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-347" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="347">#347</a>)</p>
<p>These rules apply not only to <span class="romanized">he</span>, but also to <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, <span class="romanized">lamed</span>, or <span class="romanized">bet</span> representing a preposition with the vowel of the definite article.</p>
<p>Where the <span class="romanized">he</span> has a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, if it is a musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent, but if it is a phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 14) states that, as a rule, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in this situation is phonetic, so the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. Various examples are given, mainly in two categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Words on which musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> would not be used for reasons of structure, as Amos 6:3 <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְנַדִּ֖ים</span>.</li>
<li>Words which could take a musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable of regular type, but which have a conjunctive accent, so that such a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> would not normally be marked (see <a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="319">#319</a>, <a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-320" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="320">#320</a>), as 2C 32:31 <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְשַׁלְּחִ֤ים</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In words in these two categories, then, the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is phonetic and the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> vocal. This is followed by a list of words in which the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent. Most of these words are words which could take musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in a closed syllable of the regular type, and which have a disjunctive accent, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>1S 18:7</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְשַׂחֲק֖וֹת</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nu 5:19</td><td rowspan="2"><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְאָרְרִ֖ים</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nu 5:24</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Some, however, have a conjunctive accent, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>2K 23:5</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְקַטְּרִ֣ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>And in some the structure is not regular, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Is 23:12</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְעֻשָּׁקָ֞ה</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>In these cases the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is musical, and the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent.</p>
<p>Some sources give rules for determining whether <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal or silent in such cases by the number of letters in the word.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it has five letters, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְסֻכָּ֣ן</span> (Is 40:20) then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal.</li>
<li>If it has six or more letters, and the accent sign is on the fifth or sixth, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְצַפְצְפִ֖ים</span> (Is 8:19) then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent,</li>
<li>but if the accent sign is on the fourth letter, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְחַכִּ֣ים</span> (Job 3:21), then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some exceptions to these rules are also listed.</p>
<p>The rule given in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> covers most of the cases, but not all. The other rules, however, cover an even smaller proportion. In some MSS, notably in <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, the <span class="romanized">mem</span> in this situation is pointed with <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span> when the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal, which gives a clear indication of the pronunciation.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-383">383</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> after Phonetic <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> in Other Situations</span>. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under other letters is vocal when it follows phonetic $gaya. Examples are:-</p>
