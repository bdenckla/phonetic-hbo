<h1><span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-376">376</h3>
<p>The distinction of silent from vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was a great concern for the Masoretes for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>This was necessary for correct pronunciation, since vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was realized as an ultra-short vowel, but silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> as no vowel.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> acted as a guide to the syllable structure of the word. Neither type of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was considered to form a syllable. Rather, both types of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> were considered to be dependent on an adjacent “full vowel”; silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the preceding vowel, and vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> on the following vowel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus in <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁכְּנוּ</span> (Gen 25:18) the silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span> goes with what precedes, and the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> goes with what follows, so that the word is divided <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁ-כְּנוּ</span>.</p>
<p>And in <span lang="hbo">וְהָאֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִים</span> (Est 9:3), which has vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s <span lang="hbo">וְהאחשדרפְנים</span>, the syllabic structure is <span lang="hbo">וְהָ-אֲחַשְׁ-דַּרְ-פְּנִים</span> (<span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>, like simple vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, depends on (belongs to the syllable of) the following vowel).</p>
<p>Phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-346" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="346">#346</a>) could change silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> to vocal, and so change the syllabic structure of a word. The word <span lang="hbo">וּזְהַב</span> without <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is divided <span lang="hbo">וּזְ-הַב</span>, but with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (Gen 2:12) it becomes <span lang="hbo">וּֽ-זְהַב</span>. In the same way at the end of a word, silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (whether marked or only potential) marks the division. In <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא</span> (Gen 1:1), if the potential <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">tav</span> were vocal, the division would be <span lang="hbo">בְּרֵא-שִׁי-תְבָּ-רָא</span>.</p>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (i): The General Rule</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-377">377</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The only exception to this is found in the forms of <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּיִם</span>. Here the initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent, a pronunciation made possible among the Tiberians (according to some sources, e.g. Levi, 1936, p. ט, translation p. 8*) by the use of a helping vowel, as <span lang="hbo">אֶשְׁתַּיִם</span>. This helping vowel was evidently the source of the disagreement over the accentuation of the word when it has <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> with no preceding conjunctive (Lev 23:17, Ez 1:11, two times in Ez 41:24). Those who pronounced this initial helping vowel as a full vowel considered that the word was not stressed on its first syllable, so that the <span class="romanized">pashṭa</span> sign was required, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁתַּ֙יִם֙</span>. Those who did not pronounce the helping vowel as a full vowel considered the word as stressed on its first syllable, and so marked it with <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-207_285.html#yeivin-numbered-section-248" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="248">#248</a>). Even in this there was disagreement, however, as bA put the <span class="romanized">yetiv</span> in its normal, prepositive position, before the <span class="romanized">shewa</span>, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֚תַּיִם</span> (so <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr>), while bN put it after, as <span lang="hbo">שְׁ֤תַּיִם</span>, as one would expect for a <span class="romanized">mehuppak</span> not a <span class="romanized">yetiv</span>.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-378">378</h3>
<p>At the end of a word, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent. Most sources also say that when two <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s come together at the end of a word, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּ֣בְךְּ עֲלֵהֶ֑ם</span> (Gen 45:15), both are silent. However some sources state that the first is silent and the second vocal, unless the word occurs at a major pause, as <span lang="hbo">וַיֵּֽבְךְּ׃</span> (Gen 29:11), in which case all agree that both are silent.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-379">379</h3>
<p>Within a word, where <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is marked on two successive letters, the first is silent and the second vocal. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under a letter marked with <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> is vocal. Apart from these two clear cases, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> within a word is consider silent, with the exception of several special categories of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> which are noted in various masoretic sources.</p>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> below <span class="romanized">resh</span></span>. The Masorah gives rules on the subject of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span>, but these are not the same in different sources. It is said that in nouns, if <span class="romanized">resh</span> is the second letter, and has <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> or <span class="romanized">ṣere</span> before it, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as</p>

<tr><td>Ex 19:2</td><td><span lang="hbo">מֵרְפִידִ֗ים</span></td></tr>

<p>If it has <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> or <span class="romanized">ḥolem</span> before it, however, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as</p>

<p>Rules on <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> in verb forms are given for particular roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>גרשׁ – If there is a <span class="romanized">segol</span> under the <span class="romanized">shin</span>, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Ex 23:30 <span lang="hbo">אֲגָרְשֶׁ֖נּוּ</span>. Otherwise the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent, as Jud 11:2 <span lang="hbo">וַיְגָרְשׁ֣וּ</span>, with the exception of Ps 34:1 <span lang="hbo">וַ֝יְגָרְשֵׁ֗הוּ</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shin</span> has <span class="romanized">ṣere</span>, but the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal in the opinion of bA (although bN considers it silent).</li>
<li>ברך – If the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">bet</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is silent, as 1C 29:20 <span lang="hbo">בָּ֥רְכוּ נָ֖א</span>. If the accent is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">resh</span> is vocal, as Gen 27:34 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֥נִי</span>, with the exception of Dan 4:31 <span lang="hbo">בָּרְכֵ֔ת</span>, where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent even though the accent sign is on the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 21)).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">resh</span> is considered vocal also in Gen 18:21 <span lang="hbo">אֵֽרְדָה־נָּ֣א</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span>), Ps 83:13 <span lang="hbo">נִ֣ירְשָׁה לָּ֑נוּ</span> (given as a case of agreement between bA and bN), and, according to bA, Job 31:37 <span lang="hbo">אֲקָֽרְבֶֽנּוּ׃</span>, where <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> and <abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> have <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>. However, bN considers the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> silent in this last case.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-380">380</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under other letters</span>. The Masorah gives rules for the pronunciation of <span class="romanized">shewa</span> in some other verb forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>אכל – If the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> has a <span class="romanized">segol</span>, then a <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">kaf</span> is vocal as Dt 12:24 <span lang="hbo">תֹּאכְלֶ֑נּוּ</span>. Otherwise the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent as Nu 11:19 <span lang="hbo">תֹּאכְל֖וּן</span>, with the exception of Qoh 5:10 <span lang="hbo">אֹכְלֶ֑יהָ</span> where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is considered silent even though the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> has a <span class="romanized">segol</span>. This is stated in <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 22), and is also given in the <span class="romanized">Sefer ha-Ḥillufim</span> as the opinion of bA. However, bN regards the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">kaf</span> as silent in all cases.</li>
<li>הלך – <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under the <span class="romanized">lamed</span> is silent except in the long form of the imperfect where the accent is retracted to the first syllable, and the following word has conjunctive <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-394_416.html#yeivin-numbered-section-405" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="405">#405</a>), as Ex 4:18 <span lang="hbo">אֵ֣לְכָה נָּ֗א</span> (<span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 25)). (<abbr title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">MsL</abbr> has <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span>.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Recognition of Vocal <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> (ii): Special Cases</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-381">381</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> following Phonetic <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></span>. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> following a short vowel is usually silent, even where this vowel has musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="319">#319</a>). However if the short vowel has phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> intended to show that the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal, it is, of course, vocal. The situation in which phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is used are described above (<a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-345" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="345">#345</a>). The Masorah gives rules covering some of these situations.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-382">382</h3>
<p><span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under <span class="romanized">Mem</span> following <span class="romanized">He</span> with <span class="romanized">Pataḥ</span> at the Beginning of a Word</span>. (cf. <a href="yeivin_itm-345_357.html#yeivin-numbered-section-347" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="347">#347</a>)</p>
<p>These rules apply not only to <span class="romanized">he</span>, but also to <span class="romanized">bet</span>, <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, or <span class="romanized">lamed</span> representing a preposition with the vowel of the definite article.</p>
<p>Where the <span class="romanized">he</span> has a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, if it is a musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent, but if it is a phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, the following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. The <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 14) states that, as a rule, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in this situation is phonetic, so the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal. Various examples are given, mainly in two categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Words on which musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> would not be used for reasons of structure, as Amos 6:3 <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְנַדִּ֖ים</span>.</li>
<li>Words which could take a musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable of regular type, but which have a conjunctive accent, so that such a <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> would not normally be marked (see <a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-319" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="319">#319</a>, <a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-320" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="320">#320</a>), as 2C 32:31 <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְשַׁלְּחִ֤ים</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In words in these two categories, then, the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is phonetic and the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> vocal. This is followed by a list of words in which the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent. Most of these words are words which could take musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in a closed syllable of the regular type, and which have a disjunctive accent, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>1S 18:7</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְשַׂחֲק֖וֹת</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nu 5:19</td><td rowspan="2"><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְאָרְרִ֖ים</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nu 5:24</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Some, however, have a conjunctive accent, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>2K 23:5</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְקַטְּרִ֣ים</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>And in some the structure is non-regular, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Is 23:12</td><td><span lang="hbo">הַֽמְעֻשָּׁקָ֞ה</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>In these cases the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is musical, and the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent.</p>
<p>Some sources give rules for determining whether <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal or silent in such cases by the number of letters in the word.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it has five letters, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְסֻכָּ֣ן</span> (Is 40:20) then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal.</li>
<li>If it has six or more letters, and the accent sign is on the fifth or sixth, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְצַפְצְפִ֖ים</span> (Is 8:19) then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent,</li>
<li>but if the accent sign is on the fourth letter, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽמְחַכִּ֣ים</span> (Job 3:21), then the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some exceptions to these rules are also listed.</p>
<p>The rule given in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> covers most of the cases, but not all. The other rules, however, cover an even smaller proportion. In some MSS, notably in <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, the <span class="romanized">mem</span> in this situation is pointed with <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span> when the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal, which gives a clear indication of the pronunciation.</p>

<p><span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> after Phonetic <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> in Other Situations</span>. <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> under other letters is vocal when it follows phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.

<p>The study of the pointing of <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr> in this situation, and comparison of it with other early MSS, reveals a somewhat different rule. If there is a short vowel before the first of a pair of identical letters, the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is silent unless it follows <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> or is marked as a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> (whether <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked or not). If the preceding vowel is long, the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is always vocal, whether <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked or not (for a long vowel before <span class="romanized">shewa</span> may always take <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-318_344.html#yeivin-numbered-section-326" class="ref-to-numsec" data-num-of-sec="326">#326</a>)).</p>

<p>It seems probable that, although the rules given above cover most of the cases in which <span class="romanized">shewa</span> within a word was considered vocal, they do not cover them all. Apart from those cases mentioned in the rules, however, and the few exceptional cases, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> within a word was considered silent, whether it followed either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a short vowel, as <span lang="hbo">וַיִּשְׁלַ֤ח</span> (Gen 8:9)</li>
<li>a long vowel (even if it had musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>) as <span lang="hbo">שָֽׁמְע֔וּ</span> (Gen 43:25)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Pronunciation of <span class="romanized">Shewa</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-387">387</h3>
<p>From the point of view of quantity, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> represented an ultra-short vowel&thinsp;—&thinsp;even shorter than a short vowel. From the point of view of quality, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> usually had the same sound as <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span>. If it was followed by a guttural, however, the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> had the same quality as the vowel following the guttural. Thus</p>
<ul>
<li>in <span lang="hbo">בְּאֵר</span> the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was pronounced as a very short <span class="romanized">ṣere</span>,</li>
<li>in <span lang="hbo">מְאֹד</span> as a very short <span class="romanized">ḥolem</span>, and </li>
<li>in <span lang="hbo">לֻֽקְחָה־זֹּֽאת׃</span> (Gen 2:23) as a very short <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> (indeed here some MS have <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span>, i.e. <span lang="hbo">לֻֽקֳחָה־זֹּֽאת</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>(For the Tiberians, the <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span> sign always represented the same vowel quality, “ɔ” (open-mid back rounded), so <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span> and <span class="romanized">qameṣ ḥaṭuf</span> (<span class="romanized">qameṣ qaṭan</span>) differed from <span class="romanized">qameṣ gadol</span> only in quantity.) If the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> was itself under a guttural, however, it was pronounced with the quality of <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span> even where it was followed by a guttural, as</p>

<h2><span class="romanized">Ḥaṭef Shewa</span> under a Non-Guttural Letter</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-388">388</h3>
<p>Only under gutturals does Tiberian pointing regularly distinguish vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> from silent <span class="romanized">shewa</span>. In many cases, however, <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under other consonants is represented by <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> to indicate that it is vocal, in some&thinsp;—&thinsp;sometimes in most&thinsp;—&thinsp;of the MSS and printed texts. This may occur either for morphological or for phonetic reasons.</p>
<p>(i) <span class="yeivin-underline-as-heading"><span class="romanized">Ḥaṭef Shewa</span> Used for Morphological Reasons</span>. This occurs most commonly where the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> derives from a “u” or “o” vowel, in which case the sign used is <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span>. This is especially common under <span class="romanized">qof</span>, <span class="romanized">gimel</span>, the other <span class="romanized">begad-kefat</span> letters, <span class="romanized">ṭet</span>, and the sibilants <span class="romanized">ṣade</span> and <span class="romanized">shin</span>.

<p>In some MSS, such as <abbr title="Aleppo (see section #26)">MsA</abbr>, <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> is commonly used under non-guttural letters in all the categories described. In others, like <abbr title="Sasoon 507">MsS</abbr>, this is rare. Clearly the Masoretes considered the use of a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> sign to mark vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> under a guttural as necessary, but under other letters as optional. Thus, for instance, the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan 1967, section 19) says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some scribes, following a valid tradition, read <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span> in many places ... while others, also following a valid tradition, do not, but there is no (authoritative) source but the preference of the scribes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly it is said in the <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span> p. 64 (Dérenbourg, 1870, p. 372):</p>
<blockquote><p>If one argues that the <span class="romanized">dalet</span> of “Mordecai” (and other letters in other words) has <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span>, tell him, “but this sign is only a device used by some scribes to warn that the consonants should be pronounced fully, and not slurred over.” <span class="romanized">Ḥaṭef qameṣ</span> is written in some texts. It is not used in others, but the reader nevertheless pronounces the word in the same way when he comes to read it.</p>

<p>According to the rules given above, initial <span class="romanized">shewa</span> before <span class="romanized">yod</span> followed by <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> should sound like a very short <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> as <span class="romanized">lĭyiśrɔʾel</span> for <span lang="hbo">לְיִשְׂרָאֵל</span>.

<tr><td><span lang="hbo">וִֽילֲלַ֖ת</span></td><td>Jer 25:36</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">לִֽיקְּהַ֫ת־אֵ֥ם</span></td><td>Prov 30:17</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">כִּֽיתֲר֥וֹן</span></td><td>Qoh 2:13</td><td><abbr title="Sasoon 1053">MsS1</abbr></td></tr>
</table>
<p>In these cases the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> following the <span class="romanized">yod</span> is vocal, so that the <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> occurs in an open syllable. In all other cases, bA marks the two vowels (<span class="romanized">shewa</span> and <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>) separately. In contrast, bN requires the long “i” vowel in these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>All בכל-prefixed versions of the following four words:<ul>
<li><span lang="hbo">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span></li>
<li><span lang="hbo">יִזְרְעֶאל</span></li>
<li><span lang="hbo">יִרְאָה</span></li>
<li><span lang="hbo">יִרְאַת</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some other specific words, such as:<ul>
<li><span lang="hbo">וִיטַ֥ב</span> (2K 25:24)</li>
<li><span lang="hbo">לִירְאָתֶֽךָ׃</span> (Ps 119:38)</li>
<li><span lang="hbo">וִיחֵ֑לּוּ</span> (Job 29:21)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(By “בכל-prefixed,” I mean beginning with exactly one prefix, where that prefix is the preposition <span class="romanized">bet</span>, <span class="romanized">kaf</span>, or <span class="romanized">lamed</span>.)</p>
<p>Ben Naftali does not require the long “i” vowel, and so agrees with bA, in all other cases. Notable cases of agreement include words having:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly one prefix, where that prefix is not a בכל prefix. E.g., <span lang="hbo">וְיִשְׂרָאֵל</span>.</li>
<li>Two prefixes. E.g., <span lang="hbo">וּבְיִשְׂרָאֵל</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-393">393</h3>
<p>Most of the early MSS conform to bA in the pointing of these words, but <abbr title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">MsC</abbr>, and in the main <abbr title="Sasoon 507">MsS</abbr>, conform to bN.</p>
<p>There are a few words in the Bible pointed with <span class="romanized">shewa</span> followed by <span class="romanized">yod</span> and <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span> where long “i” would be expected, as</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">וַיְּיִ֣ף</span></td><td>Ez 31:7</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">לְיִסּ֑וֹד</span></td><td>2C 31:7</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is possible the result of over-correction&thinsp;—&thinsp;the long “i” was avoided even where it should have been used.</p>
<p>The system of punctuation used in these situations in the MSS with expanded Tiberian pointing is related to the system of bN, but in these MSS long “i” is marked when any prefix is followed by <span class="romanized">yod</span> with <span class="romanized">ḥireq</span>. Thus, in <abbr title="Karlsruhe MS #3: Codex Reuchlinianus of the Prophets">MsR</abbr></p>
<table>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">וִיתֶּן־עֹ֣ז</span></td><td>1S 2:10</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="hbo">וִירָ֖שׁ</span></td><td>Is 57:13</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This contrasts with the real ben Naftali system.</p>
