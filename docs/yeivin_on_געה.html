<p><span class="yeivin-underline">Regular Structure</span>. A word of the same structure as <span lang="hbo">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span>, which has a closed syllable, separated from the stress syllable by another (the "buffer" syllable) followed by vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (simple or <span class="romanized">ḥatef</span>&thinsp;) is said to have "regular" structure. In words of such structure, the initial closed syllable has <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> if the word has a disjunctive accent, as <span lang="hbo">נִֽתְחַכְּמָ֖ה</span>. In the pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְקַטְּלִים</span>, the vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> stands under a letter with <span class="romanized">dagesh</span> "forte" (follows a doubled consonant). It may also be the second of two <span class="romanized">shewa</span> s, in a form of pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְפַּלְפְּלִים</span>, as <span lang="hbo">הַֽכַּרְמְלִֽי</span> (1S 30:5), or a <span class="romanized">ḥatef</span> <span class="romanized">shewa</span> in a form of pattern <span lang="hbo">מִתְפַּעֲלִים</span> as <span lang="hbo">מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֖ים</span> (Gen 37:9).
