<h1>[Initial Remarks on] <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h1>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-311">311</h3>
<p>Some information on <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is included in the rules on the accents given in the <span class="romanized">Diqduqe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (Dotan, 1967, sections 14, 15, 20, and elsewhere). The statements on <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the masoretic literature and the works of the early grammarians are few and unsystematic. The most detailed treatment of the rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is that given by Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan (published in Gumpertz, 1958). It was Yequtiʾel who set up different categories of the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, introduced the terms “light <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on an open syllable) and “heavy <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>” (<span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable).</p>
<p>The survey of rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in the <span class="romanized">Miqneh Abram</span> of Abram di Balmes, and in Heidenheim’s <span class="romanized">Sefer Mispeṭe ha-Ṭeʿamim</span> (45a–60b) was based on those of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan. Eliahu ha-Levi also gives detailed rules on the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>—though less systematic than those of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan, in <span class="romanized">Ṭuv Ṭaʿam</span> chapter 7. The same is true of Shelomo Yedidyah Norzi’s <span class="romanized">Maʾamar ha-Maʾarik</span>.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive survey of the rules for <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is that in Baer 1869. These rules were derived from the study of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in late MSS, and in some cases Baer imposes a system where none is evident in his sources. Nevertheless, Baer’s rules were adopted in scholarly grammars, such as Bergsträsser 1918 (vol. 1, #11).</p>
<p>A few surveys of the system of marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in early MSS have been published. The system used in <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span> is briefly described in Hartom, 1952. The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in several MSS is briefly described in Greenspan, 1961. A detailed description of the marking of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span> is given in Yeivin, 1968, p. 19–194 (on the 21 books) and p. 241–277 (on the three books).</p>
<h2>The Name <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-312">312</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> (גַעְיָה or גִיעְיָה) is the older name for this sign (a short vertical stroke under the word), and is used in the masoretic literature. The absence of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is called <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>, as in the masorah magna of <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span> at Prov 4:16:</p>
<blockquote><p>איוב <span lang="hbo">לֹא יִשְׁנוּ</span> חטף משלי <span lang="hbo">לֹא יִֽשְׁנוּ</span> געי</p>
<p>Job [29:22] <span lang="hbo">לֹא יִשְׁנוּ</span> has no <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>; Proverbs [here (4:16)] <span lang="hbo">לֹא יִֽשְׁנוּ</span> has <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note that the word ישנו has a different meaning in the two cases.) <span class="romanized">Metheg</span> (מֶתֶג), the later name for the sign, and that common today, is first known from the work of Yequtiʾel ha-Naqdan (first half of the thirteenth century). Eliahu ha-Levi (beginning of the sixteenth century) already suggests that <span class="romanized">metheg</span> is the correct term, and that <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> was only a name for one of the classes of <span class="romanized">metheg</span> (that with <span class="romanized">shewa</span>).</p>
<h2>The <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> Sign</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-313">313</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is marked by a short vertical stroke under the word (generally on a syllable before the main stress syllable, on which an accent sign is marked). In printed texts the stroke is really vertical, and this is also the case in most MSS, but in some MSS it is slanted a little to the right (to distinguish it from <span class="romanized">merka</span>, which is slanted to the left). In the <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span> it is said that bA and bN use this form of the sign, but it is characteristic of only a few early MSS.</p>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> forms part of the accent system, and is generally marked only in MSS in which the accent signs are marked, but not in those which show only vowel signs. <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is not easily confused with the accent signs, as it is generally marked before the stress syllable, while most accent signs are marked on the stress syllable.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-314">314</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> is generally written to the left of a vowel sign marked under the same letter. In some MSS, such as <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span> and <span title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">L</span>, this convention is carefully maintained, with very few exceptions—and those usually due to correction, or to lack of space in the regular position. In other MSS, such as <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span>, <span title="Sasoon 507">S</span>, <span title="Sasoon 1053">S<sup>1</sup></span>, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is often written to the right of the vowel sign, without any particular reason. With <span class="romanized">shewa</span> also, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is generally written to the left of the <span class="romanized">shewa</span> sign, but there are MSS inwhich it is often written to the right. The same is generally true of <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef shewa</span> signs, but in some MSS, such as <span title="Leningrad MS B19a (see section #30)">L</span> and <span title="Sasoon 1053">S<sup>1</sup></span>, the <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> sign may be written between the two parts of the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> sign; <span lang="hbo">אאֲ‍ֽא</span>. This does not occur in <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span> and <span title="Cairo Codex of The Prophets (see section #32)">C</span>.</p>
<h2>The Function of <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-315">315</h3>
<p><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> has no musical motif of its own, but indicates that the reading of the syllable on which it is marked is to be slowed own, and not slurred over, as noted in <span class="romanized">Horayat ha-Qore</span> p. 77 (Dérenbourg, 1870, p. 385):</p>
<blockquote><p>But <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, which has the form of a stroke inclined backwards, and is found under some words, is neither a disjunctive nor a conjunctive accent, but indicates that the syllable must be lengthened a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is probable that this slowing down of the reading of the syllable is the main function of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, not the raising or trilling of the tone. It is possible however, that, as time went on, <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> came to be viewed as a secondary accent, and the rules for its use were changed, so that it came to be read with a raising of the pitch, and a short motif of its own.</p>
<h2>The Categories of <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-316">316</h3>
<p>The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> can be divided into two groups of categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="yeivin-underline">Musical</span>: Categories determined by the needs of the Biblical chant. The marking of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in these categories is dependent on the syllabic structure of the word, and on the accent on that word or of the one preceding or following. Most examples of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> belong in these musical categories.</li>
<li><span class="yeivin-underline">Phonetic</span>: Categories dependent on the consonants and vowels of the word, or of the preceding or following words. Few examples of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> belong in these phonetic categories.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not always possible to determine the reason for which <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked. In some cases it could be either musical or phonetic, but this is of no importance. Whatever the reason for marking <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, its function is always the same: to slow the reading of the syllable, whether this is required for musical reasons at the beginning of a particular motif, or for phonetic reasons, to ensure the clear pronunciation of all the sounds of a word.</p>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-317">317</h3>
<p>The use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> in different sources differs greatly. In general, most categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> are not marked consistently in MSS, while in printed texts a number of categories are marked systematically. For the study of the early MSS it is most important to note the categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> which are mentioned in masoretic treatises, and those mentioned in the <span class="romanized">Sefer ha-Ḥillufim</span>, since the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is the area in which bA and bN differ most frequently. The categories of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> are as follows:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Musical.<ol>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable (“small” or “heavy” <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>) in a word the structure of which can be “regular” or “not regular”.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on an open syllable (“great” or “light” <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>).</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Shewa</span> <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> on a closed syllable with a “long” vowel.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Phonetic.<ol>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used to render a following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> vocal.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used on account of a guttural.</li>
<li><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> used in the roots היה and חיה.</li>
</ol>
</li>
