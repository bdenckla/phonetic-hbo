<h1>Phonetic <span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span></h1>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-345">345</h3>
<p>Some <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> s are not affected by the syllabic structure of the word, or by its accent. They have a phonetic, not a musical function. They have several purposes, among them <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> with a short vowel (or even a long vowel) to show that a following <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is vocal, and <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> before a guttural to slow down the reading of the vowel so that the guttural may be pronounced properly. It is not always clear what particular fault in pronunciation phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> was intended to remedy. However the effect of phonetic <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is the same as that of musical <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>: the slowing down of the reading.</p>
<h2><span class="romanized">Gaʿya</span> Marking a Following <span class="romanized">Shewa</span> as Vocal</h2>
<h3 id="yeivin-numbered-section-346">346</h3>
<p>This <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> is marked in various situations: before a consonant which has lost its historical doubling, before a sibilant consonant, before a group of similar consonants, etc. In some cases not only is the vowel before such a consonant marked with <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>, but a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is marked after it as well (<a href="yeivin_itm-part_4_aka_appendix-shewa.html#yeivin-numbered-section-391">#391</a>), but this is not done consistently either with words of the same structure, or with the same words in different MSS. Some MSS mark the <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> frequently (and this is one of the unique characteristics of <span title="Aleppo (see section #26)">A</span>). Others mark it rarely. The quality of this <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is determined by the Tiberian rules for the pronunciation of vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> (<a href="yeivin_itm-part_3-mus_gaya.html#yeivin-numbered-section-336">#336</a>, <a href="yeivin_itm-part_4_aka_appendix-shewa.html#yeivin-numbered-section-387">#387</a>). Before a non-guttural other than <span class="romanized">yod</span>, or a guttural pointed with <span class="romanized">pataḥ</span>, <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef pataḥ</span> is used. Before a guttural pointed with <span class="romanized">qameṣ</span>, <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef qameṣ</span> is used. Such a <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span> is unlikely to occur before a guttural pointed with other vowels, or before <span class="romanized">yod</span>.</p>
