<h1>D1 rarely</h1>
<p>How did Yeivin determine that Rule D1 is not obeyed in manuscripts in which vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span>
is <em>rarely</em> made explicit? There are two ways I can think of that he might have done this.</p>
<ul>
<li>One way is by applying a criteria of internal consistency. What I mean by that is the following.<ul>
<li>If we assume that the “vocality” of a word’s <span class="romanized">shewa</span> does not vary
across verses,</li>
<li>but we see, in some particular manuscript, that the use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span>
in that word does vary across verses,</li>
<li>then we could say, for that word at least, that Rule D1 is not obeyed in that manuscript. And,
of course, if we see this inconsistent use of <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> across many words
in that manuscript, then we could say, for the manuscript as a whole, that Rule D1 is not obeyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other way is by applying a criteria of external consistency. What I mean by that is the
following. Let’s say we have two manuscripts, a reference one like <abbr title="Aleppo Codex (see section #26)">μA</abbr>,
in which vocal <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is often made explicit, and one under scrutiny,
in which that is not the case: usually only simple <span class="romanized">shewa</span> is used.<ul>
<li>If we assume that the “vocality” of a word’s <span class="romanized">shewa</span> does not vary
across these two manuscripts,</li>
<li>but we see that the manuscript under scrutiny lacks <span class="romanized">gaʿya</span> where
the reference has <span class="romanized">ḥaṭef</span>,</li>
<li>then we could say, for that word at least, that Rule D1 is not obeyed in the manuscript under
scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
